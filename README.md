# SFSU-Coding-In-CPlusPlus
Small programs written in C++, as part of multiple courses at San Francisco State University
Overview:
- Exceptions: getProductID() function, Account class and how to throw and handle exceptions
- GeneralTree: Implement GeneralTree class, constructor, destructor, traversal of tree, insertion of nodes, print contents of tree, avoid memory leaks 
- Dijkstra: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
- Recursion: create isPalindrome(), digitSum(), waysToClimb() a staircase, by applying recursion 
- GG1_Simulator: Queuing simulator which simulates a G/G/1 queue (only a prototype) 
- BigInteger: Develop a BigInteger() function that displays big versions of integers, but do it in the most efficient way possible (procedural programming).
